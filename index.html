National Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts and National Museum of Natural Science are worth some close explorations. Yunlin is known to the world as the place of origin of puppet theatre. It is also worth some fine appreciation.</p>

                <p>Southern Taiwan is full of history and culture. Tainan City is the island's oldest city. Until the late 19th century, it had also been a political, economic and cultural hub. Thus, the city features plenty of historic sites. The Tropic of Cancer passes through Chiayi County, and thus Tropic of Cancer Solar Exploration Center has been built to highlight the city's unique geographical trait. World-famous Alishan Forest Recreation Park boasts high-elevation forest railways and off-the-beaten-track old hiking trails, making it a must-see for visitors in Taiwan.                </p>

                <p>Eastern Taiwan includes two counties, Hualien and Taitung. It faces the vast Pacific Ocean on the East and leans against the Central Mountain Ridge on the West. Standing in between such magnificent waters and mountains, when the Portuguese sailed by during their early explorations, they exclaimed "formosa," meaning "how beautiful" in their language. That's how Taiwan acquired its other name "Formosa," and this reveals how beautiful eastern Taiwan is. Eastern Taiwan is blessed with lots of natural resources, an old farming culture, and kind-hearted locals. Known as the "back yard" of Taiwan, it is ideal for a slow trip. Take a walk on this paradise on Earth, take some deep breaths, and breathe in sweet air. Long stay is recommended here.                </p>

                    <p>The Chinese New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, is celebrated from the first to the fifth day of the first month of the Chinese lunar calendar. Literally, Chinese people refer to this festival as "passing the year," which means shooing out the old and welcoming the new; it is considered the most important Chinese holiday of the year. There are a number of related customs and traditions that go along with the festival. Normally, on the 23rd or 24th day of the last month of the Chinese lunar calendar, people sacrifice to the Hearth God and send him off on his annual journey to Heaven; this signals the start of the Chinese New Year holidays.                    </p>

                    <p>The Lantern festival is also known as the "little New Year." Aside from the usual worship of the gods, the occasion involves guessing lantern riddles, eating rice-flour dumplings, and releasing lanterns into the sky in New Taipei City's Pingxi Township. The Yanshui Beehive Rocket Festival in Tainan County is another major event during the Lantern Festival. Colorful lanterns of all sizes and shapes have always been main attractions of the Lantern Festival, which is celebrated with a grand national festival and other major festivals in Taipei and Kaohsiung.</p>

                    <p>The Qingming Festival or Ching Ming Festival,also known as Tomb-Sweeping Day in English (sometimes also called Chinese Memorial Day, Ancestors' Day, the Clear Brightness Festival, or the Pure Brightness Festival), is a traditional Chinese festival observed by ethnic Chinese in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, Cambodia, Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. A celebration of spring, it falls on the first day of the fifth solar term (also called Qingming) of the traditional Chinese lunisolar calendar. This makes it the 15th day after the Spring Equinox, either 4, 5 or 6 April in a given year. During Qingming, Chinese families visit the tombs of their ancestors to clean the gravesites and make ritual offerings to their ancestors. Offerings would typically include traditional food dishes and the burning of joss sticks and joss paper. The holiday recognizes the traditional reverence of one's ancestors in Chinese culture.                    </p>

Because of its origins and customs, it is closely related to the remembrance of Qu Yuan, a poet who lived during the Warring States Period. That is why, from ancient times, people have also referred to the Dragon Boat Festival as the" Poet's Festival."                    </p>

                    <p>The Mid-Autumn Festival, also called the Moon Festival, is the holiday with the most romantic atmosphere. Because this holiday occurs during the autumn, when the harvest season is over, people in earlier days chose this day to make offerings and thank the gods for the bountiful harvest. The celebration has become a time for families to get together. The most familiar myth concerning this festival is that Chang-e flying to the moon after secretly drinking her husband's elixir of life. Aside from this, there are also tales of the Jade Rabbit and of "Wu Gang chopping down the cassia tree."                    </p>
